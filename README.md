# Samir Al Bahr â€“ 2D Character Animation

## Overview
**Samir Al Bahr** is a 2-minute 2D character animation project developed as part of my coursework at the University of Sharjah. The project brings to life a character named **Samir**, an adventurous octopus with a deep curiosity about the sea world and a dream of uniting all sea creatures.

## Story
Samirâ€™s journey begins when he is discovered by a diver inside a mysterious wooden barrel at the bottom of the sea. As he grows, he becomes a hopeful hero destined to uncover the secrets of an **erased underwater city**, where sea creatures once lived in harmony. Samir dreams of reuniting the tribes and hosting a grand sea-wide dinner.

## Animation Structure
The 2-minute animation is built around three main storyboards:
1. **Origin Story** â€“ A diver finds baby Samir in a barrel deep underwater.
2. **The Quest Begins** â€“ Older Samir tries to retrieve a flying map and falls off a cliff, showing his humorous side.
3. **Exploration and Resilience** â€“ Samir climbs a tree trunk for a better view, falls again, and quickly recovers, emphasizing his lighthearted and determined spirit.

## Visual Dictionary
A detailed visual dictionary was also created, documenting Samirâ€™s outfit, accessories, inspirations, and environmental elements.
